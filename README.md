This repository contains the Computer Assignments from the "Digital Currency" course at the University of Tehran in the Spring of 2024.

## [Assignment 1](./CA1/)

In this assignment, we used python cryptography library to encrypt and decrypt a message with symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms. We used AES and RSA algorithms for symmetric and asymmetric encryption, respectively. We also used the RSA algorithm for digital signature.

## [Assignment 2](./CA2)

In this assignment, using python libraries we created some transactions in testnet of bitcoin. We used bitcoin script to create a simple transaction, a multi-signature transaction and a password protected transaction.

In the second part of the assignment, we created a local ethereum network using geth and mined some blocks.

## [Research Project](./ResearchProject/)

My research project was about coded merkle tree. I had to read [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01247) and provide a report and a presentation about it which is available in the [Research Project](./ResearchProject/) directory.
